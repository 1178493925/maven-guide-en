  <title>Foreword: Alpha 0.12</title>

  <para>Remember, this is an alpha-release. Expect some spelling errors and
  some crazy grammar problems; I'm a bit dyslexic, and I tend to overuse the
  semicolon. We're approaching a milestone and we're pouring resources into
  quality control and making sure that we have a work worth publishing, so
  expect the copy to improve over the next few weeks.</para>

  <para>If you are interested in helping improve the book please send
  feedback. The book will be getting some attention from some professional
  copy editors in a few weeks, but your help is appreciated. I'll collect a
  list of people and add it into the final version that we submit to
  preproduction for the printed book. If you do send feedback, let us know if
  it is alright to include your name on the list of people who have helped
  improve this book.</para>

  <para>We've had some great feedback so far, please keep it coming. Your
  feedback is greatly appreciated, send it to <ulink
