  <title>Foreword: Beta 0.16</title>

  <para>Alright, we're in a Beta release now. What does this mean? Not much,
  really it just means that I no longer feel like we're going to have massive
  structural changes between now and the 1.0 release of this book. We might
  have another chapter added into the mix, we might not. At this point, we're
  focusing on clarity and completeness of what we have now, and we're also
  very much focused on limiting the size and scope of the book.</para>

  <para>You'll notice that the Nexus and m2eclipse chapters have been updated
  in this release and that they both contain a large amount of screenshots.
  We've been focusing on these chapters as they serve a dual role. While they
  are chapters in this book, each chapter also serves as documentation for
  each project.</para>

  <para>We've had some great feedback so far, please keep it coming. Your
