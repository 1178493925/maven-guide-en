    <title>Maven by Example</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>The first Maven book was the <ulink
      url="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596007508/">Maven Developer's
      Notebook</ulink> from <ulink
      url="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly</ulink>, it was a book that
      introduced Maven in a series of steps. The idea behind the Developer's
      Notebook series was that developers learn best when they are sitting
      next to another developer and going through the thought process that
      another developer uses to learn and code. While the Developer's Notebook
      series has been successful, there is a downside to the notebook format:
      notebooks are, by design, "goal-focused" books that take you through a
      series of steps to achieve specific goals. Larger reference books, or
      "Animal" books are there to provide comprehensive material which covers
      the entirety of the topic. Both books have advantages and disadvantages,
      but publishing one without the other is a recipe for problems.</para>

      <para>To illustrate the problem, consider that after ten thousand people
      read a developer's notebook, they will all know how to create a simple
      project, say a Maven project that creates a <acronym>WAR</acronym> from
      a set of source files. But, when they want more details or the specifics
      for something like the Assembly plugin, they hit something of an
      impasse. Because there is no well-written reference material for Maven,
      they have to hunt through plugin documentation on the Maven site or cull
      through a series of mailing lists. Once people start to really dig into
      Maven, they start reading through thousands of poorly written
      <acronym>HTML</acronym> documents on the Maven site written by hundreds
      of different developers each with a different idea of what it means to
      document a plugin: hundreds of developers with varying writing styles,
      tones, and native languages. Despite the best efforts of hundreds of
      well-meaning volunteers, reading through plugin documentation on the
      Maven site, is, at best, frustrating and, at worst, a reason to abandon
      Maven. Quite often Maven users get "stuck" because they just can't find
      an answer from the site documentation.</para>

      <para>While the first Maven Developer's Notebook attracted new users to
      Maven, and trained people on the most basic use case of Maven, this same
      population of readers grew frustrated when they couldn't find a concise
      well-written reference manual. This lack of an authoritative (or
      definitive) reference manual has held Maven back for a few years; it has
      been something of a dampening force on the Maven user community. This
      book intends to change this situation by providing both an update to the
      original Maven Developer Notebook in <xref linkend="part-example" />,
      and the first attempt at a comprehensive reference in <xref
      linkend="part-reference" />. What you have in your hands (or on your
      screen) is really two books in one.</para>

      <para>In this part of the book, we're not abandoning the narrative
      progression of a Developer's Notebook, it is valuable material that
      helps people learn Maven "by example". In the first half of the book we
      "introduce by doing", and in <xref linkend="part-reference" /> we fill
      in the blanks, dig into the details, and introduce advanced topics which
      might be distracting to a new Maven user. Where <xref
      linkend="part-reference" /> might use a reference table and a program
      listing detached from an example project, <xref
      linkend="part-example" /> is going to be motivated by a real example and
      a good story. After reading <xref linkend="part-example" />, you should
      have everything you need to start using Maven for a few months. You
      might only need to return to <xref linkend="part-reference" /> when you
      need to start customizing Maven by writing custom plugins or when you
      want more detail about specific plugins.</para>
