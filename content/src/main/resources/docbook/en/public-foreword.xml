  <title>Foreword: Beta 0.18</title>

  <para>Q. Wait, the book was sent to the printers and ink was applied to dead
  trees, but the book is still in Beta? What does this mean?</para>

  <para>A. It means that we're in this for the long haul. If we've been
  working on this book for the better part of the year and we're only on Beta
  0.18, it means that we're still working to realize our vision of an ideal
  book. Expect a steady stream of improvements and additions to the book over
  the coming months.</para>

  <para>Q. Will we ever emerge from this book's Beta?</para>

  <para>A. Maybe not. Remember, GMail is still in Beta. If this book moves out
  of Beta, we're essentially saying that there is no more to add. I've always
  thought that good books evolve over time and that they live beyond the
  confines of the chapters and sections that define them. A good book is an
  ongoing conversation and a series of interactions not just between authors
  and readers, but of lateral interactions between readers.</para>

  <para>We've published a book with O'Reilly that will (to use a cliche)
  "stand the test of time". The printed version of this book contains
  information that will remain relevant and accurate going forward, and we
  encourage everyone to go out and purchase a book today. Even if you don't
  need it for yourself, you should go to Amazon, purchase a copy and give it
  to a friend who hasn't discovered Maven.</para>

  <para>Q. What's new in this version?</para>

  <para>Many typo fixes thanks to our generous Get Satisfaction participants,
  and a new, pre-alpha version of an Archetype chapter.</para>
